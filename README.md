## 🌸 Flower Classification using Machine Learning
# 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying different types of flowers using machine learning techniques. The aim is to train a model that can accurately predict the category of a flower based on its features, contributing to practical applications in computer vision and image recognition.
#⚙️ Features
1.Data preprocessing and cleaning
2.Feature extraction from flower datasets
3.Implementation of machine learning classification models
4.Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
5.Visualizations to interpret model performance
# 🛠️ Tech Stack
1.Python
2.Pandas, NumPy (data handling)
3.Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
4.Scikit-learn / TensorFlow/Keras (model building — depending on your implementation)
